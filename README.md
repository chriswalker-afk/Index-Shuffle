# Index Shuffle

**Slide. Multiply. Discover. Bank.** A browser-based, 2048-inspired exponent game for maths students.

## Play

[Launch Index Shuffle](https://chriswalker-afk.github.io/Index-Shuffle/) once the updated game is deployed to GitHub Pages. No login, backend, or build system is required.

- Swipe the **4×4 board**, use the arrow keys, WASD, or click the direction controls.
- Tiles with the same **base** merge by adding exponents, for example **3² × 3³ → 3⁵**. Each tile can participate in at most one merge per swipe.
- Every **successful slide** normally spawns one number tile. From **slide 40 onwards, every tenth successful slide** (40, 50, 60, …) can spawn a **second** number tile, as long as there is an empty square. The game starts with bases **2, 3, 5**, then unlocks **7 after 15 successful slides, 11 after 35, and 13 after 60** (six bases maximum). New bases start rare and increase their spawn share over the next 12 slides. Discovered higher powers can also appear as rare spawns.
- **Escalating blockers** begin at **move 10** (tier 1, one required hit), then progressively at **20** (two hits), **30** (three), **40** (four) and **50 onward** (five, the maximum). The game allows **at most two active blockers**, and only schedules another when a suitable empty square is available.
- **Next-turn warning:** at **move 9, 19, 29, 39, …**, an eligible empty square is highlighted with a yellow **! NEXT** marker. That square is reserved for one turn, cannot be entered or crossed by number tiles, and changes into the advertised blocker **on the next successful slide**. The marked square is guaranteed to be the blocker's location; if no safe place exists or the blocker cap is reached, that warning/blocker pair is skipped. Warning squares cannot be banked or damaged. Scheduling the warning preserves at least one possible swipe.
- **Breaking blockers:** once active, blockers stay fixed and split rows/columns into sliding segments. Each merge that finishes **directly next to a blocker** (up/down/left/right, not diagonally) deals one hit. Older blockers retain their original tier when harder ones unlock. On the final hit the blocker disappears, freeing the square for later turns. Existing saved three-hit blockers remain at their original difficulty.
- A glowing **✦** tile (exponent 2 or higher) can be **banked once per base–exponent combination**, provided you calculate its exact value within **60 seconds**.
- **Banking does not empty a square.** Banking **5⁷**, for example, scores the original power but replaces that square with a randomly selected **smaller, already unlocked power of 5**. A plain **5** (exponent 1) remains the fallback. **The replacement has a one-successful-slide banking cooldown**, so another bank is never available immediately on that tile. Banked powers can still spawn or merge but cannot be banked again.
- **Banking cooldown:** the replacement tile, an incorrect attempt, or a timeout creates a **⌛** one-slide lock on that square (when the tile is otherwise bankable). One **successful slide** clears all these temporary locks. Other tiles remain bankable, and cancelling an attempt does not impose a penalty.
- A full board is **not automatically game over**: you may still merge tiles or bank a power. The game ends only when there are no legal slides/merges and no currently bankable tiles.
- Moves animate briefly (170 ms). System **reduced motion** preferences disable animations. Banking timers pause while the browser tab is hidden.
- Game state and high score are saved in the current browser between visits. A new game resets the current run but keeps your best score.

## Tests

Run **node tests.mjs** and **node hazards.tests.mjs** (Node 18+). GitHub Actions runs both tests, JavaScript syntax checks, and static entrypoint verification on pushes and pull requests.

The engine and hazard regression tests cover exponent merging in all directions, next-turn highlighted warning squares with exact-location conversion, reserved movement barriers, progressive 10-move blocker tiers, safe placement and the two-blocker cap, legacy saves, orthogonal damage/destruction, periodic extra spawns, progressive bases, banking cooldowns, and game-over conditions including isolated empty squares. The answer timer and visual effects should also be checked manually on desktop and mobile.

## Technical notes

The game is plain HTML, CSS, and native JavaScript modules, with no external runtime dependencies.

- **engine.mjs:** deterministic game rules, sliding segments, blocker damage, dual spawning, power replacement, and question validation.
- **app.mjs:** DOM interactions, timer, progress storage, and short motion animations.
- **styles.css:** responsive visual design, including reduced-motion support.

Spawn probabilities are weighted at roughly **85% base tiles, 11% discovered squares, 3% discovered cubes, 1% higher discovered powers**, automatically reweighted when a category has not been discovered. Within the base tile pool, a newly unlocked base starts at **30% of the normal per-base weighting** and ramps to equal weight across 12 successful slides. The progression stops at six bases. Blockers and extra spawns are spaced deliberately to limit sudden difficulty jumps; their cadence and the three-hit threshold can be adjusted after playtesting.

## Publishing

GitHub Pages uses **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Deploy from a branch**, with branch **main** and folder **/(root)**. The **.nojekyll** marker ensures that the supplied game entrypoint (**index.html**) is served instead of generating a README-based website.

For local development, serve the directory over HTTP, for example using **python3 -m http.server 8000**, then open http://localhost:8000/. Browser module imports may fail when directly opening a local file URL.
